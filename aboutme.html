      <p class="aboutme">
        I am a self-taught developer who has successfully navigated the software development industry. My journey began with a deep-rooted passion for programming, cultivated since a young age. Determined to pursue my true calling, I transitioned from the hospitality business to the dynamic world of software development in my 20s.

      <p class="aboutme">
        Over the past three years, I have honed my expertise as a Front-End Developer, progressing from a Junior to a Senior position. In this role, I took charge of directing the codebase and independently managing various projects. My approach to coding emphasizes simplicity, ensuring that the code is not only clean and efficient but also easily understandable by all team members. I firmly believe that clear code fosters a smoother workflow for everyone involved.

      <p class="aboutme">
        I thrive on challenges and enjoy tackling them head-on. While specializing in Front-End development, I have ventured into Python and Java, exploring the Back-End context with the hope of gaining hands-on experience in that domain someday. My inclination for unconventional problem-solving sets me apart, and I am always eager to push beyond my comfort zone to expand my knowledge and skill set.

        I have a proven track record of successful remote work, having exclusively operated in a remote setting throughout my career. I am committed to remaining a remote worker in the future, recognizing the efficiency and flexibility it affords. However, I am very much open to periodic check-ins and am willing to travel for these meetings.
